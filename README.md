# ioet-challenge
You will need NodeJs to run this challenge. I used Code Runner extension to test the output.

The way i came up with this solution was to traverse each employee's timetable and store them in an array of arrays. I added a '}' at the end of each timetable so I know when an employee's timetable ends. Each array contains the timetables of each data set from an employee. That way I would compare one employee's hours to another.
